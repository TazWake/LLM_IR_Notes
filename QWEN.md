# Qwen Code Context for LLM_IR_Notes

This document provides context for Qwen Code to understand and assist with the contents of the `LLM_IR_Notes` directory.

## Directory Overview

This directory is a repository dedicated to storing notes, documents, and potentially scripts related to Large Language Model (LLM) Incident Response. The primary focus is on methodologies and guidelines for investigating security breaches involving LLMs.

## Key Files

1.  **`README.md`**: A brief description indicating the repository's purpose for LLM incident response materials.
2.  **`LLM_Breach_Investigation_Guide.md`**: A comprehensive guide detailing a structured methodology for investigating LLM security incidents. It integrates OWASP GenAI recommendations, forensic practices, and real-world case studies. It covers preparation, identification, evidence collection, analysis, containment/eradication/recovery, and ongoing monitoring. It also includes a flowchart and a quick checklist.
3.  **`LICENSE`**: Contains the MIT License for the repository.
4.  **`.gitignore`**: Standard Python `.gitignore` file to exclude compiled files, environments, caches, and other temporary or sensitive files from version control.

## Usage

This repository serves as a knowledge base for LLM incident response procedures. The main document, `LLM_Breach_Investigation_Guide.md`, is the core resource. Any future scripts or tools added to this directory should align with the investigative methodologies outlined in the guide.

## Project Type

This is a **Non-Code Project**. The primary content consists of Markdown documentation providing guidance and procedures for LLM security incident investigations. While the `.gitignore` suggests a Python environment might be used for future scripts, no code files (like `*.py`) are currently present in the main directory.
